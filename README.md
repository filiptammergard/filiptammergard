I live in Uppsala, Sweden. 🇸🇪

For work I'm enabling electric and autonomous shipping at [Einride](https://github.com/einride). ⚡️

I'm leading the [Einride UI](https://github.com/einride/ui) project—a React implementation of Einride's design system. 🎨

Accessibility is in my heart and I try to consider it in everything I do. 💟

Feel free to reach out on Twitter if you want to say hi! 🙏

## Open Source

I'm passionate about open source. Here's a list of some of the open source projects I'm involved in:

- [React-TypeScript Cheatsheet](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react): A cheatsheet that helped me a lot when I started working with React together with TypeScript. I'm helping maintain and improve it.
- [namedays](https://github.com/filiptammergard/namedays): A minimal API for Swedish namedays I created. Open for anyone to use, feedback and contribute to!
- [Einride UI](https://github.com/einride/ui): A React implementation of Einride's design system. I've been leading and working on the project from the start.
